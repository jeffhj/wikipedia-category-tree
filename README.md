# Wikipedia Category Tree

Several scripts that generate/process Wikipedia category tree:

- `get_wikipedia_category_tree.py`  get the Wikipedia category tree with a root link
- `get_wikipedia_pvi_month.py` get the number of "page views in the past 30 days" for each keyword in the tree
- `convert_tree_to_edges.py` convert the category tree to edges with several filtering rules
